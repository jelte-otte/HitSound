### THIS IS A FORK FROM THE ORIGINAL HitSound MOD AND NOT THE OFFICIAL MOD!

The HitSound Mod enhances your Minecraft experience by allowing you to customize the sound that plays when you hit an entity. With this mod, you can select your preferred hit sound and adjust its volume directly from the Mod Menu settings.

- Customizable Hit Sound: Choose from a variety of .ogg sound files to play when you hit an entity.
- Volume Control: Adjust the volume of the hit sound to your liking.
